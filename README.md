Tic-Tac-Toe is a famous game played by almost everyone. The same game is now being implemented in the code. The game allows 2 people to play simultaneously. 

The player1's position will be marked with 'X' and that of the player2's position by 'O'.

Once, either of the players win or the match results in DRAW, the game terminates with appropriate output...
